    <h1>My Experience</h1>
    <p>Here is a brief summary of my professional and academic experience.</p>

    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
    <h3>Video Producer at IGN</h3>
    <p>I worked at IGN for just over two years in San Francisco, California, as a video producer for the news team. I thoroughly enjoyed my role, particularly the opportunities to branch out and edit content beyond news. The team was fantastic to work with, and I valued my time there.</p>
    <p>However, the pandemic disrupted our operations, and we all transitioned to working remotely. To my knowledge, we never returned to our original studio, and IGN later acquired a smaller studio post-lockdown.</p>

    <h3>Transition to IT</h3>
    <p>After my time at IGN, I sought new opportunities that aligned with my long-standing interest in IT. My first job at 15 was at a PC repair shop in my hometown in Ireland. I repaired customers' laptops, typically handling virus removals and system reinstalls. This early experience sparked my passion for technology and problem-solving.</p>
    <p>In my pursuit of an IT career, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skills, particularly in cybersecurity and programming. I continuously seek to learn and grow in this field, driven by my curiosity and desire to help others through technology.</p>
