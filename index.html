      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
         I have been tinkering with computers and game consoles since I was 12. Never lost my fascination with technology. Now I am looking to make IT my career. I enjoy problem solving especially if it can help others. I am new to this field as far as professional work but I am diving head first into learning everything I can.
      </p>
      <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
      <p>
         I'm working on getting more Tryhackme certificates and learning some programming.
